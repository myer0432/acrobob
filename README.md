AcroBob is a reinforcement learning agent being developed in the Open AI Gym Acrobot-v1 environment using tile coding with Q-learning, SARSA, and expected SARSA.

## Recent update
Sarah: Just added the Base.py file that Mel and I have been working on. Contains new tiling implementation. Tiling works but needs to be expanded to more dimensions (currently at 2, we have 4). Mapping of states needs to be more robustly tested and tiling has not been tested with actual agent actions, only simulated samples. After that we have a plan for implemention of learning. We plan on tackling all of these today.
